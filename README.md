## Description
In this project our group created an application that serves as a mock stock portfolio. The user can create an account, then proceed to select a stock from our curated list to add to their porfolio. Our app keeps track of the price and number of stocks that you purchased in a ledger, so that you can keep track and learn from the investments that you make!  

## Usage
When presented with the homepage of this application, you are able to either log in to an existing account or sign up. Once successfully logged in, you will then be able to browse stock options by clicking the green "Find Stocks" button. You can select a stock from the drop down, enter the amount of shares you would like to invest in, and then click the "Get Stock Quote" button. The current price of the stock, along with the requested shares and the total cost will then appear beneath. When you click the "Confirm Puchase" button, it adds that stock to your portfolio.
